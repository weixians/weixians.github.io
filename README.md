# My homepage
Go to [my homepage](https://weixians.github.io/) to check the running result.

This site is based on the project of [Pudhina](https://knhash.github.io/Pudhina/) which is a Jellky website available for Github pages. 
I extend the features to support more awesome features for the self-introduction website.

## How to use it
- Start by cloning the repository, then check the `_config.yml` file and change it accordingly. Note that the `title` property is what will be displayed as logo.
- Execute `jekyll serve` and head to [localhost:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000) to see the results locally.

## Customization
- Change main picture and icon in `/assets/img/pudhina`.  
- Change main details regarding site in `_config.yml`.
- Configure `index.md` for the main page, `blog.md` for Blog listing and `resume.md` for Resume page.
- CSS properties can be found in `/assets/css/main.css`.
- New posts to be created in the `/_posts/` directory, follow the naming convention used in samples. Front-matter requires title, subtitle, categories and date.
