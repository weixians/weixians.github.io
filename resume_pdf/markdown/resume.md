Research Projects
----------

**Subgoal-driven robot navigation in indoor environments**

* Master thesis project, with [project link](https://github.com/weixians/subgoal-nav) available.

  * A hierarchical navigation framework for a lidar equipped robot navigating in indoor environments with unknown static obstacles and pedestrians.
  * The high-level agent predicts subgoal position for next fixed time period, while the low-level agent aims to achieve the subgoal.
  * The result will be rearranged and submitted to ICRA 2023.

* **techniques**: Deep reinforcement learning (DDPG, TD3), Pybullet, ROS, Python, C++

**Enhanced Spatial Attention Graph for Motion Planning in Crowded, Partially Observable Environments**

* Paper accepted by [ICRA 2022](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9812322), with [link](https://www.hrl.uni-bonn.de/publications/shi22icra.pdf) available.

  * Propose a new neural network based on reinforcement learning for human-aware partially observable environments.
  * This approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods.

* **techniques**: Deep reinforcement learning (Double DQN, imitation learning), Python

Some Work projects
--------------------

**Investment relation map for JD stock app**

* Company: JD.com
* A Spring project providing data for JD stock app.
* Integrate data from multiple MySQL databases, find and aggregate the relationship between major shareholders and companies in massive data,
  and store the results in Redis.
* **Learned**: Quickly and efficiently aggregate useful information from large amounts of data.

**Web match system for electronic laser shooting sports events**

* Company: Zhuhai Guangge Technology
* A web-based match system to hold sports matches, collect scores from Android app and display the real-time ranking information. 
* Separating the system into several modules, in which Spring cloud is used to help communicate with each other.
* Websocket is used to maintain the messaging between frontend, Java backend and Android app.
* **Learned**: Spring boot, Vue.js, Websocket, Mysql, Redis, MongoDB

**Android APP of laser shooting systems for sporting events**

* Company: Zhuhai Guangge Technology
* An app for middle school student-athletes that receives hardware device data via Bluetooth, and visualizes laser transmitter firing positions, trigger pressure data, etc.
* This app can receive and parse data from different types of hardware devices.
* In addition, synchronous backup of data is also implemented based on socket and http, as well as its use in competition scenarios.
* **Learned**: Android, Bluetooth, socket, http, Realm database, MVP design pattern
